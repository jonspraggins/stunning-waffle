# Tinkering-Nerd
## Description
<p>This is a pet project of sorts.  It's designed to do help a researcher on a specific person or topic.</p>
<p>Put simply, takes the input from the forms and passes the query-string to select websites</p>
<p>It's all coded in Javascript, mainly because I don't know how to make this a more elegant process while keeping it relatively light.</p>

## Note
<p>It opens multiple tabs based on the number of sites you wish to search on, so you may have to temporarily trust this site/allow pop-ups in your respective browsers.</p>
<p>This was the only way I could think of to return the relevant data.</p>
<p>I'd like to reach out to the community to help further the development of this tool, both to widen it's search capability and broaden it's scope.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated</p>
