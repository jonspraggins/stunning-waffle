a simple search tool
This is a pet project of sorts.  It's designed to do help a researcher on a specific person or topic.
It's all coded in Javascript, mainly because I don't know how to do all the cool database stuff that would probably make this a more elegant process.
It opens multiple tabs based on the number of sites you wish to search on, so you may have to temporarily trust this site/allow pop-ups in your respective browsers.
This was the only way I could think of to return the relevant data.
